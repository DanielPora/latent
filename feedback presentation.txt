- Give LPA the ground truth number of classes and see results (adding RI and NMI for given ground truth in the results tabel)

- Suggestion: reduce number of possible classes to more practical amount 3-5 in context of psycholinguistic experiments

- Change LMEM from gaussian also to bernoulli (logistic regression) to get compareable approaches

- Group FB and RL already in experiment design, add justification (correlation of 0.99)

- Investigate RI and NMI disagreements, specify what that means

- Better criteria to distinguish scenarios, naming according to parameters

- Explain why the individual noise exists. What justifies it's distribution? Or leave it out completely?
